## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - For chart

### What I learned

I've improved a little working with Typescript and I have learned to use Chart.js

### Continued development

I will continue working with Typescript I think is powerful and pretty. I'm going to continue development Frontend Mentor projects.

### Useful resources

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - This helped me. I think the documentation is one of the best way to learn sometimes.
